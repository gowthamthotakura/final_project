IBM Watson AI-Based Web Application Development and Deployment

Introduction

In this final project for this course. I have demonstrated knowledge and skills in app creation and web deployment. The project involved creating an emotion detection application using the Watson AI libraries and deploying it as a web application using Flask. I am required to perform various tasks and submit the results.

Emotion Detection

Emotion detection goes beyond sentiment analysis by extracting more nuanced emotions like joy, sadness, anger, and more from text statements. This capability is essential for AI-based recommendation systems, chatbots, and other applications. In this project, we will harness the power of Watson AI to create an emotion detection application.

Project Tasks


Task 1: Clone the Project Repository

Start by cloning the project repository to your local environment. This will provide the necessary code and resources to begin your work. https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/oaqjp-final-project-emb-ai.git


Task 2: Create an Emotion Detection Application

Utilise the Watson NLP library to develop an emotion detection application. This application will analyse text input and identify the underlying emotions.

Task 3: Format the Output

Ensure that the output of your emotion detection application is well-formatted and user-friendly. Users should be able to understand the emotions identified.

Task 4: Package the Application

Package your application for ease of deployment. You should have a clear and concise set of instructions for deploying it.

Task 5: Run Unit Tests

Test your application thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected. Create unit tests to validate its behaviour.

Task 6: Deploy as a Web Application Using Flask

Take your emotion detection application and deploy it as a web application using the Flask framework. This step involves making your application accessible over the web.

Task 7: Incorporate Error Handling

Implement robust error handling to ensure that your application gracefully handles unexpected situations.


Goal:

Created an Emotion Detection application using functions from embeddable AI libraries.
Relevant information was extracted from the output received from the function.
It has been tested and packaged into the application created using the Emotion Detection function.
Completed web deployment of the application using Flask.
I have incorporated error handling in the application to account for invalid input.
Wrote code that complies perfectly with PEP 8 guidelines, achieving a 10/10 score in static code analysis.


Task 8: Run Static Code Analysis

Perform static code analysis to review your code for potential issues, code quality, and adherence to best practices.
By completing these tasks, I have created a functional emotion detection web application that users can access on the internet.
